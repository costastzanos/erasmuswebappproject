<h1>What is this?</h1>

**This is a project for the ERASMUS+ 2025 Madrid, developed by Constantinos Tzanodaskalakis & George Kallitsounakis 🌳🐻**

This is a simple web-app project that uses AR libraries and HTML/CSS, it's a web app that can be used on hotel keycards and tourist attractions, by scanning the QR Code, the phone displays the location in a 3D scan/model, as well as information about the specific location. 📱

In this example, by scanning the QR Code, the web app opens up on your phone/tablet and displays the 3D hotel "Melodia City Hotel", as well as information about your booking, such as room number, check-in & check-outs, room type, services provided etc.

<h1>How can this be used?</h1>

From the user's side, it's pretty simple.
All the user has to do is scan the QR Code, and they get redirected to the Web App. 📷

From the developers side, all they require to use it is simple knowledge on HTML/CSS:

1. Use the index.html file to customize information
2. Use the hotelinfobox.css file to customize the looks of the web app
3. Insert their own model and name the 3D file 'model.glb'

And it's done and ready to be installed on your server! 🤓

<h1>How can this be integrated in hotels?</h1>

It's quite simple actually, all you need is:

1. Server (either run locally or through cloud)
2. This repository modified according to the hotel

You can print out a QR code on a hotel keycard or keychain and make the QR code immediately redirect to the local or cloud server. 😁👍
